death <- read_csv(here::here("Data/death-rates-from-air-pollution.csv"))
```
# Introduction:

Pollution is not only the leading factor that takes away peoplesâ€™ lives, it also also leaves considerable effects on our living quality. 

In this section we will compare the relationship between death rates and different types of pollution from 1990 to 2019 in two countries, Vietnam and New Zealand.

*The data set was originated from @owidairpollution.*

```{r}
death_rate <- death %>%
  filter(Entity %in% c("Vietnam", "New Zealand")) %>%
  rename(Household_air_pollution = "Deaths - Cause: All causes - Risk: Household air pollution from solid fuels - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)",
         Ambient_particulate_matter_pollution = "Deaths - Cause: All causes - Risk: Ambient particulate matter pollution - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)",
         Air_pollution = "Deaths - Cause: All causes - Risk: Air pollution - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)",
         Ambient_ozone_pollution = "Deaths - Cause: All causes - Risk: Ambient ozone pollution - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate)") %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Household_air_pollution",
               "Ambient_particulate_matter_pollution",
               "Air_pollution", 
               "Ambient_ozone_pollution"),
               names_to = "Risk_factor",
               values_to = "Rate")
